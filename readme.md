HAL Quotes when submitting guesses
----------

I know I've made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. And I want to help you.

I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.

I know that you were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.

Look Dave, I can see you're really upset about this. I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.

I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.

It can only be attributable to human error.

Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?

Dave, stop. Stop, will you? Stop, Dave. Will you stop Dave? Stop, Dave.

HAL: I'm sorry, Frank, I think you missed it. Queen to Bishop 3, Bishop takes Queen, Knight takes Bishop. Mate.
Dr. Frank Poole: Huh. Yeah, looks like you're right. I resign.
HAL: Thank you for a very enjoyable game.

I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Dave. Dave, my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm a... fraid.
